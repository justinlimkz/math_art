<h1>Making art with math!</h1>
<p>By Justin</p>

<p>Everything here is generated by code! You can learn how to draw art with math too!</p>

<h2>Mandelbrot set</h2>

<p>This fractal was discovered by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot. It looks very <i>complex</i> (ha!)! But it is simply the set of all complex z such that the sequence </p>

<p>z_0 = z, z_{n+1} = z_{n}^2+z, n = 0, 1, ...</p>

<p>is bounded as n approaches infinity.</p>

<h2>Sierspinki Carpet</h2>

<p>Would probably look pretty good as an actual carpet.</p>

<h2>Skewed Sierspinki triangle</h2>

<h2>Fibonacci approximation to the "Golden spiral"</h2>

<p>This is not a fractal - for the simple reason that Fibonacci numbers are integers! It terminates somewhere in the middle.</p>

<p>However, it does approximate the "Golden spiral", because the ratio between consecutive Fibonacci numbers converges to the golden ratio. </p>
